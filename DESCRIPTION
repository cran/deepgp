Description: Performs Bayesian posterior inference for deep Gaussian processes 
    following Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon (2023, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2012.08015>).  See Sauer 
    (2023, <http://hdl.handle.net/10919/114845>) for comprehensive methodological 
    details and <https://bitbucket.org/gramacylab/deepgp-ex/> for a variety of 
    coding examples. Models are trained through MCMC including elliptical 
    slice sampling of latent Gaussian layers and Metropolis-Hastings 
    sampling of kernel hyperparameters.  Vecchia-approximation for faster 
    computation is implemented following Sauer, Cooper, and Gramacy 
    (2023, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2204.02904>).  Downstream tasks include sequential design 
    through active learning Cohn/integrated mean squared error 
    (ALC/IMSE; Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon, 2023), optimization through 
    expected improvement (EI; Gramacy, Sauer, and Wycoff, 2022 <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2112.07457>), 
    and contour location through entropy 
    (Booth, Renganathan, and Gramacy, 2024 <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.04420>).  Models 
    extend up to three layers deep; a one layer model is equivalent to typical 
    Gaussian process regression.  Incorporates OpenMP and SNOW parallelization 
    and utilizes C/C++ under the hood.
