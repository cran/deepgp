Description: Performs Bayesian posterior inference for deep Gaussian 
    processes following Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon (2023, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2012.08015>).  
    See Sauer (2023, <http://hdl.handle.net/10919/114845>) for comprehensive 
    methodological details and <https://bitbucket.org/gramacylab/deepgp-ex/> for 
    a variety of coding examples. Models are trained through MCMC including 
    elliptical slice sampling of latent Gaussian layers and Metropolis-Hastings 
    sampling of kernel hyperparameters.  Gradient-enhancement and gradient
    predictions are offered following Booth (2025, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2512.18066>).
    Vecchia approximation for faster 
    computation is implemented following Sauer, Cooper, and Gramacy 
    (2023, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2204.02904>).  Optional monotonic warpings are 
    implemented following Barnett et al. (2025, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2408.01540>).  
    Downstream tasks include sequential design 
    through active learning Cohn/integrated mean squared error (ALC/IMSE; Sauer, 
    Gramacy, and Higdon, 2023), optimization through expected improvement 
    (EI; Gramacy, Sauer, and Wycoff, 2022, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2112.07457>), 
    and contour location through entropy (Booth, Renganathan, and Gramacy, 
    2025, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.04420>).  Models extend up to three layers deep; 
    a one layer model is equivalent to typical Gaussian process regression.  
    Incorporates OpenMP and SNOW parallelization and utilizes C/C++ under the hood.
